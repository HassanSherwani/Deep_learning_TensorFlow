# Neural Network 
Aim is to build a 2-hidden layers fully connected neural network (a.k.a multilayer perceptron) with TensorFlow.

This example is using some of TensorFlow higher-level wrappers (tf.estimators, tf.layers, tf.metrics, ...), you can check 'neural_network_raw' example for a raw, and more detailed TensorFlow implementation.
